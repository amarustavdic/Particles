## Particle Simulation

### Overview
This project is a simple particle simulation where particles interact based
on their charge. Positively charged particles attract other positively
charged particles, and negatively charged particles attract other negatively
charged particles, while opposite charges repel each other. The particles
move within a bounded rectangular area.
